# bazel-0.14.1-armv7l-kali-java8

My armv7l build of bazel 0.14.1 on Kali arm/NetHunter built with JDK8.  The binary is attached to the release. (Disclaimer: ymmv, but I've tried it in 2 arm environments so far and it works in both.)

This is step one of my master two-step plan to build TensorFlow natively on armv7l.
